Please provide the Network Team with the following validation steps:
1. DNS Resolution

Verify that each of the following hostnames resolves to a valid IP address:

xmc.nam.msroot.net  
xmc-engage.nam.msroot.net  
issgusxwcmxcbv004.nam.msroot.net  
issgusxwcmxcbv001.nam.msroot.net  
issgusxwcmxcbv002.nam.msroot.net  
issgusxwcmxcbv003.nam.msroot.net


(These are the endpoints that the application cycles through when logging in.)

2. Port Accessibility

Check that TCP port 15001 is reachable for all above hosts:

telnet <hostname> 15001


or

Test-NetConnection <hostname> -Port 15001


For example:

Test-NetConnection issgusxwcmxcbv004.nam.msroot.net -Port 15001

3. Firewall / Proxy Rules

Confirm that no firewall, proxy, or Bloomberg network policy is blocking or delaying:

outbound HTTPS or SOAP traffic to the Engage/XMC URLs

outbound TCP connections to port 15001

DNS queries to the above hostnames

4. Routing Check

Perform a route trace from the Bloomberg desktop:

tracert issgusxwcmxcbv004.nam.msroot.net


We need to confirm there is no routing delay or network isolation right after the workstation reboot.

5. Network Behavior After Reboot

Since users cannot log in for 10–15 minutes after terminal restart, please check:

Are DNS caches stale after reboot?

Are Bloomberg terminals placed in a quarantined VLAN for the first 10–15 minutes?

Are any Bloomberg post-boot security policies applied that may temporarily restrict external connectivity?

Does the firewall apply a warm-up period before allowing outgoing traffic?

This “warm-up window” fully aligns with the behavior we see in logs (application iterates through all endpoints and fails because none are reachable).

Summary

From the application side everything is operational:
the client cycles through multiple Engage/XMC nodes, but cannot establish any connection until ~10–15 minutes after reboot.
This strongly indicates a Bloomberg desktop network restriction during the initial boot period.

Once the Network Team validates DNS, ports, routing, and Bloomberg network policies, we can proceed further if needed.
